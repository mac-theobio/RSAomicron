We need to decide on a final cut date and data set for preprint 2.

On the SG side, I've done some of the archaeology about old fits, and I'm not that worried. It is hard to compare the current tmb fits to analogous mle fits, because the older fits were done by fitting specificity only â€“ when we fit both sensitivity and specificity we don't get a lot of confidence intervals. Actually, maybe I should be worried after poking around a bit with Mike. Maybe Carl can help figure out what happened in the past.

We need to decide whether to consider using the non-standard beta binomial parameterization, and if we consider it, we need to decide the criteria that will use to pick between it and the standard parameterization.

On the SR side, we additionally need to decide about whether to add a random effect for province by date.

Oops. Possibly more important: we need to decide about a random effect (by province) for the reinfection coefficient itself.

We're not currently worried about reinfection denominators because our model asks about the effect of reinfection status on omicron/delta.

Do we need two Dropboxes? What is the starting data for what?
